    <p>The first version of HTML was written by <strong>Tim Bernes-Lee</strong> in <em>1993</em>.Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML. The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which became an official standard in December 1999.</p>
    
    <p>Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language. XML is a standard markup language that is used to create other markup languages. Hundreds of XML languages are in use today, including GML (Geography Markup Language), MathML, MusicML, and RSS (Really Simple Syndication). Since each of these languages was written in a common language (XML), their content can easily be shared across applications. This makes XML potentially very powerful, and it's no surprise that the W3C would create an XML version of HTML (again, called XHTML). XHTML became an official standard in 2000, and was updated in 2002. XHTML is very similar to HTML, but has stricter rules.<u> Strict rules are necessary for all XML languages, because without it, interoperability between applications would be impossible</u>.</p>
    
    <p>Most pages on the Web today were built using either HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0. However, in recent years, the W3C (in collaboration with another organization, the WHATWG), has been working on a brand new version of HTML, HTML5. Currently (2011), HTML5 is still a draft specification, and is not yet an official standard. However, it is already widely supported by browsers and other web-enabled devices, and is the way of the future. Therefore,<sub>HTML5</sub> is the<sup>primary language</sup>taught in this course.</p>
    
    <p>HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of<del>content</del>web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
    
    <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into<mark>multimedia web pages</mark>. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
    
    <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as </p><code><img> and <input></code> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> and </p> surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

    <p>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the <canvas> element, together with<cite>JavaScript</cite>.</p>
    
    <p> HTML is a<dfn> markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS.</dfn>.</p>
    <p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like <h1> and </h1>, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <img>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).

        Another important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.
        
        The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program: <samp><!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
              <head>
                <title>This is a title</title>
              </head>
              <body>
                <div>
                    <p>Hello world!</p>
                </div>
              </body>
            </html></samp>The text between <html> and </html> describes the web page, and the text between <body> and </body> is the visible page content. The markup text <title>This is a title</title> defines the browser page title shown on browser tabs and window titles and the tag <div> defines a division of the page used for easy styling. Between <head> and </head>, a <meta> element can be used to define webpage metadata.</p>
